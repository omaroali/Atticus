## 📖 About The Project

**Atticus** is a digital showcase for a furniture design project established at **Designgymnasiet (Tedes18)**. The core concept of the physical project was sustainability: taking industrial waste—specifically old EU pallets—and upcycling them into modern, functional furniture.

This repository contains the source code for the promotional website created to display the concept, the manufacturing process, and the final photo gallery.

*This project was originally developed in **2021**.*

## 🎨 Features & Pages

The site is built as a multi-page static website featuring:

* **Home:** Introduction to the Atticus brand and mission statement.
* **About:** Details on the team's development as designers with a focus on sustainability and the future.
* **Concept:** A mood board and conceptual visualization of the furniture designs.
* **Process:** A behind-the-scenes look (slideshow) at the construction and woodworking phase.
* **Photo Gallery:** A showcase of the final manufactured products.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project uses standard web technologies without external frameworks:

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for all pages (`home.html`, `about.html`, etc.).
* **CSS3:** Custom styling found in `styles.css`, `moodboard.css`, and `gallery.css`.
* **JavaScript:** Vanilla JS used for the custom image carousels/slideshows on the gallery and concept pages.
